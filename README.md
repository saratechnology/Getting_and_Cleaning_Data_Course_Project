the repo has completed the requirement as below:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Finally,clone the script of run_analysis.R into the R,and run it in your working directory, you will get a file which is the project required. Name is "tidydataset.txt"

P.S. you should change the working directory into your own real directory when you run the script in the R
